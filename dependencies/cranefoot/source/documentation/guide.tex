\SubSection{Getting started}
\SubSubSection{Windows installation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[{\Large{!}}] CraneFoot is a command line software and as such not very
  well suited for users who are accustomed to graphical user interfaces.
  There is, however, a web based interface on the CraneFoot home page that
  makes the drawing of pedigrees easier, but for practical reasons this
  option might not offer the same features as a proper installation. 
\item Unpack the installation package using WinZip or equivalent (usually 
  it is enough to just double-click the icon). It is highly recommended that
  the unpacked executable \textit{cranefoot.exe} and the exemplary data files
  are are at this point copied to a folder such as
  'c:$\backslash$cf3$\backslash$' so that they are easy to access from the
  command prompt. You can find these files from the 'win32' and 'example' 
  folders within the installation package.
\item Open the command prompt from the accessories leaf in the start menu.
  Now proceed to the directory where you unpacked the executable
  and test CraneFoot by typing\footnote{Press the return key after both lines
  to invoke the commands.} 
\begin{verbatim}
  cd c:\cf3\
  .\cranefoot config.txt
\end{verbatim}
  You should get two new files into the current directory: a PostScript
  file \textit{myPedigree.ps} and a text file
  \textit{myPedigree.topology.txt}.
\item Next, create a new directory to another location, for example 
  'c:$\backslash$cf\_test$\backslash$'. Copy the two main input files \textit{
  config.txt} and \textit{pedigree.txt} to this directory and then type
\begin{verbatim}
  cd c:\cf_test\
  c:\cf3\cranefoot config.txt
\end{verbatim}
  Again, you should get the same output files. You can use the previous
  command in any directory and supply any configuration file you want, but
  make sure all the files you list in the configuration file are
  accessible. Sometimes you may need to use full paths. For instance, suppose
  your data files are in 'c:$\backslash$cfiles$\backslash$'. You could then
  write the instructions
\begin{verbatim}  
  PedigreeFile  c:\cfiles\pedigree.txt
  PedigreeName  c:\cfiles\myPedigree
\end{verbatim}
  in your configuration file, the precise role of which is to be discussed
  in detail later. Note that since the instructions are white space
  separated, the paths must not contain white space characters. It might
  also be necessary not to use directory names over 8 characters long.
\item[$\bullet$] There is a more elegant way of calling MS-DOS programs, and
  if the above method seems cumbersome, try searching the Internet for
  ``path windows'', it should give enough links to relevant pages.
\item[$\bullet$] You should be able to cope with just two prompt commands:
  \texttt{cd target} changes directory to \texttt{target} and \texttt{dir}
  shows the contents of the current directory.
\item[$\bullet$] The biggest problems in Windows come from the long and often
  complicated file and directory names. Use \texttt{dir} to see a
  shorter version of a file name that you can use as part of your commands.
  You can also open the properties menu (right-click on an icon) to look at
  the file path that you can type in the prompt. If your file path contains
  space characters, surround it with double quotes. For example, if you have
  'c:$\backslash$pedigree project 1$\backslash$', type
  \begin{verbatim}
    cd "c:\pedigree project 1\" \end{verbatim}
  to enter the directory.
\end{enumerate}

\SubSubSection{Linux/UNIX installation}
Before you can start using CraneFoot on other than Windows systems, you have
to unpack the source code and combile it to a binary executable. In most
UNIX-based systems the compiler software is already installed. CraneFoot is
written in C/C++ and usual commands for a C++ compiler include \texttt{c++}
and \texttt{g++}, the latter is associated with the GNU compiler which is
usually a safe choice. To make the executable, unpack the installation
package (\texttt{unzip} or similar), go to the 'source' directory and type
\begin{verbatim}
  g++ -O5 -o cranefoot main.cc *.cpp -lm
\end{verbatim} 
to invoke the compiler. When it finishes, you should have a new file
\textit{cranefoot} in the directory. To test the software, move the file to
the 'example' directory and type 
\begin{verbatim}
  ./cranefoot config.txt .
\end{verbatim} 
You should get two new files: a PostScript file \textit{myPedigree.ps} and
a text file \textit{myPedigree.topology.txt}.

CraneFoot is a stand-alone executable, with no links to shared or dynamic
libraries. Furthermore, you do not need any other files to run the program. 
If you have root privileges, you can copy the executable that you compiled
to a location that is part of the execution path (e.g. /usr/local/bin).
Otherwise you can ask the system administrator to do that for you. You can
also use the executable directly through the full path: If it is in the
current directory, just type \texttt{./cranefoot} or if it is in your home
directory (e.g. /home/username) type \texttt{/home/username/cranefoot}.

\SubSection{Basic use}
CraneFoot is designed to be compatible with the so called linkage format,
where family relations are represented by a set of child-father-mother
triplets. As a result, the natural format for the pedigree file is tabulated
text with three columns, denoted by \texttt{NameVariable},
\texttt{FatherVariable} and \texttt{MotherVariable}. One of the goals in the
development of CraneFoot was to create a software with as little manual
formatting of the input files as possible. Hence the order and indeed the
location of the columns in the file is irrelevant, CraneFoot can detect them
by itself if properly instructed.

Instructions are the human interface of CraneFoot. In fact, you do not submit
the pedigree data directly to the software, rather you give it a list of
instructions that specify where to find the data, how to read it and where to
store the results. The only requirement is that the data file is tabulated by
a delimiter character, and the first row contains unique names for each
column -- a common description of a spreadsheet.

To draw a pedigree, you need at least five instructions:
\begin{verbatim}
PedigreeFile       pedigree.txt
PedigreeName       myPedigree
NameVariable       NAME
FatherVariable     FATHER
MotherVariable     MOTHER
\end{verbatim}
\texttt{PedigreeFile} contains the file path to the primary input file. In
this case it is assumed that the file is in the current working directory,
hence the file name alone should suffice. Note, however, that depending on
your platform (MS Windows in particular) you may have to list the full path
regardless of the file location. As to \texttt{PedigreeName}, CraneFoot needs
to know where to save the results, therefore you must provide a name for
your pedigree that is used as a template for naming the output files.

At this point the most important thing to note is the freedom of choosing
the name, father and mother variables . Although here the columns are named
'NAME', 'FATHER' and 'MOTHER', they could be named differently, for example
'ID', 'FatID', and 'MotID' if so desired. Even more significant is the lack
of fixed location, the mother column (\texttt{MotherVariable}) could be the
first, third or last column -- it makes no difference to CraneFoot as long
as the column heading is consistent with the one provided in the
configuration file. The only restriction is that a heading must not contain
white space characters since the configuration file must be white space
delimited. 

Assuming you have successfully installed and tested CraneFoot (go back to
the first section if not) you should already have the output files
\textit{myPedigree.ps} and \textit{myPedigree.topology.txt} available.
The topology file is a printout of the logical relations between the
individuals. It also contains the symbol coordinates, which is necessary if
you want to draw the figure yourself based on the layout from CraneFoot.

The PostScript file with the suffix .ps has three parts: First, a table of
contents shows every successfully drawn subgraph of the entire data set,
then a list of errors is printed and finally the figures themselves on
separate pages. In this case, we have just one subgraph with a generic name
'family' (we will shortly discuss how to partition the data into separate
families). Furthermore, there were no errors, and thus the second part is
omitted. The result is depicted on \FigRef{fig1}\footnote{The figure may not
be exactly what you got due to the indeterministic layout algorithm.}.

Sometimes it is useful to have a clean image of each subgraph in separate
output files. The encapsulated Postscript files (.eps) depict only the
subgraphs themselves without any extra information, and you can use
\texttt{FigureLimit} and \texttt{PageSize} to control the process.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{pspicture}(0, 0)(\textwidth, 7.5)
  \psclip{\psframe[linecolor=white](0, 0)(\textwidth, 7.5)}
  \rput(8.0, 1.9){\scalebox{0.48}{\epsfbox{figure1.eps}}}
  \endpsclip
  \psframe[linecolor=gray](0, 0)(\textwidth, 7.5)
\end{pspicture}
\caption{A clip from the basic drawing of the sample pedigree in
  \textit{pedigree.txt}. Notice that CraneFoot automatically sets
  parents' gender based on topology even if no gender information is
  available.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

In genetic studies it is often the case that you have a number of small
pedigrees of unrelated families. It is therefore important to treat them
separately and, for that purpose, you can use the \texttt{SubgraphVariable}
to name each family and to draw them on separate pages. Try removing the
comment character '\#' at the subgraph instruction in the sample file
\textit{config.txt} and running CraneFoot again, you should get a rewritten
output document with multiple pages. Note that a subgraph of one individual
is not considered a proper family.

\SubSubSection{Using multiple input files}
Before going any further, it must be emphasized that you need not put your
data in multiple input files, you can use just one. This feature is optional
and intended for cases where the user wants to integrate information from
multiple sources when drawing a pedigree. For example, you can have extensive
historical knowledge of a pedigree, but you receive clinical information on
only a handful of individuals. Often it is prudent to combine the data into a
single file, but CraneFoot can do that for you, if necessary.

Previously it was stated that the location of a particular variable
(i.e. column) is of no consequence to CraneFoot if the heading is correct. 
On that note, the flexibility can still be increased if users can define the
source file for each variable\footnote{The default source file is defined by
\texttt{PedigreeFile}.}. In order for this to work, there has to be
enough information to associate an individual in the main pedigree file with
a row in an auxiliary input file. The only way to accomplish this is to make
sure that every input file contains a name column, that is, a column with
a heading specified by \texttt{NameVariable}. A second condition is that
the father and mother variables must be in the pedigree file, this is merely
a technical convenience.

Since the whole point of this feature is to add flexibility, it is not
mandatory to have the same individuals present in every input file. In fact,
whether there are too many or too few individuals in a given input file
compared to the pedigree file means only that some data on some individuals
is missing -- it does not prevent the software from drawing the pedigree.
The next section on visualization features contains practical examples of
using multiple files.

\SubSection{Visualization features}
As is evident in \FigRef{fig1}, information about the individuals' sex should
be given to CraneFoot so that children could be drawn properly. The mechanism
is the same as before: You add a \texttt{GenderVariable} instruction to the
configuration file that tells which column contains the binary data. You can
set the character that corresponds to male (female) sex by using the
instruction \texttt{Male} (\texttt{Female}). The default is 'M' ('F'). 

The next two important features are the individual symbol color and filling
pattern, defined by \texttt{ColorVariable} and \texttt{PatternVariable},
respectively. A color is defined as a six digit integer, with the first two
digits denoting the red component intensity, the next two denoting green and
the last two denoting blue. Patterns are also coded as integers, but there is
no obvious logic since the patterns themselves are quite different from each
other, except that the values range from 1 to 99. \FigRef{fig2} depicts
some colors and all the available filling patterns.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{pspicture}(0, 0)(\textwidth, 5.0)
  \rput(7.0, 2.5){\scalebox{0.9}{\epsfbox{figure2.eps}}}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{A list of some symbol colors and all pattern and shape codes.}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

In addition to color and filling pattern, the individuals can be labeled by a
diagonal slash (\texttt{SlashVariable}, a common glyph for death), by a red
arrow head (\texttt{ArrowVariable}, used for probands) and by square brackets
around the individual's name (\texttt{TracerVariable}). All the above are
binary in nature, and work similarly: Any positive integer will draw the
glyph in question, otherwise it is not drawn. 

Finally, textual information can be attached to any individual by one or
more \texttt{TextVariable}s. Each text variable specifies a data column, and
the particular text segment in the column will be printed below the
individual's symbol. CraneFoot is able to adjust the horizontal and vertical
space, so you can use any number of segments of any length.

Now that the main features have been covered it is time to put them to
practice. First, let's examine some of the instructions in
\textit{config.txt} in detail. The \texttt{GenderVariable} has two values:
the column where the data is stored and the file where the column is stored.
By opening the file \textit{phenotypes.txt} you can see that it contains
the name column 'NAME' that is needed in identifying the rows and a column
named 'GENDER' as specified by the gender variable. Similarly, two of the
text variables point to two columns in another auxiliary input file
\textit{genotypes.txt}. The order of the lines of text that will be written
below the nodes is determined by the order in which the text instructions are
given. Therefore, the first \texttt{TextVariable} points to the name column,
just to ensure that the first piece of text is the individual's name.
Also, remember from the previous discussion that it is not necessary to use
multiple input files, here it is done just as an example.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{pspicture}(0, 0)(\textwidth, 16.5)
  \rput(6.8, 8.0){\scalebox{0.6}{\epsfbox{figure3.eps}}}
  \psframe[linecolor=gray](0.5, 0)(13.5, 16.5)
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Page layout in CraneFoot's primary output file. The family name and
  size are on the top with date stamp and page number on the top right. The
  legend is either on the left or, if it is more space efficient, on the
  bottom as in this case.}
\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

Next, try removing the comment character '\#' to activate the visualization
instructions to see what happens (\FigRef{fig3} at the end of the document).
It should be clear by now that the instruction interface is a powerful tool
to choose different visualizations from a collection of data. For example,
you could have several datasets from the same pedigree, each with a
different set of individuals and you want to create visualizations from
different points of view. Instead of making a new input file for each
drawing, you can just change the instructions without manipulating the
input files and thus save valuable time.

The third generation of CraneFoot suffers slightly from the
indeterministic algorithm that creates somewhat different layouts every
time, but in most cases you can circumvent this by using the
\texttt{RandomSeed} instruction. It will ensure that the positions on the
canvas remain the same for each run, provided that the textual features
and page properties do not change. Other useful instructions are listed in
the last section.
